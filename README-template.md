### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Useful resources

- [free code camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - This helped me for arranging the image in a responsive way. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Image responsiveness](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-responsive-image-tutorial/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to give the responsiveness to the images. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
